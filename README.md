# Description

Maze-solving algorithm employing recursive Depth First Search algorithm to look for the shortest path between two points in the maze.
DFS is not the most efficient approach for this type of problem however it provides an ability to implement the required functionality elegantly and concisely.

# How to run

- navigate to the directory
- javac *.java
- java Driver

# How to test/play

- left click on one of the squares in the maze that appears
- right click on another square
- observe the shortest path after waiting a fraction of a second
- check the console for more details about the path length, etc.
